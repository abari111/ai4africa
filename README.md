# AI state of Africa

This repository gathers proposals for solutions and ideas for the use of Artificial Intelligence in Africa. Despite being one of the continents with the least advancement in this technology, this is not necessarily due to a lack of talent, but rather a lack of ambition on the part of authorities in certain countries. While global powers are each developing their own artificial intelligences and establishing regulatory frameworks for these technologies, very few African countries are proactive in this area, despite the continent being likely the most affected by its consequences. With fake news generated by AI proliferating across the African internet, the continent is vulnerable.

Here, you will find proposals for AI applications that address the realities of the continent, organized into various themes including education, health, environment, agriculture, security and surveillance, culture, etc. You are welcome to contribute to this repository by submitting a pull request.
